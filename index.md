# Welcome to Traceability Blockchain Prototype

## Introduction

This is the repository for traceability blockchain prototype. The repository has three folders. Tracegui includes the tracegui application, traceapp includes the traceapi and standardparts contract, external includes the code to access the traceapi from another client.

The installations were tested on Ubuntu server 20.04 with a configuration of 2 GB RAM. It is recommended to start with a fresh instalallation.

## Installation

The prototype uses the Hyperledger Fabric 1.4. The detailed installation instructions is given in Hyperledger Fabric page(https://hyperledger-fabric.readthedocs.io/en/release-1.4/prereqs.html). After installing the fabric you need to run first network and install the standartparts smart contract.

```markdown
sudo apt install curl
sudo apt  -get -y install docker compose
sudo usermod -aG docker $USER
```
Restart and login again after docker installation. 

```markdown
sudo apt install curl
sudo apt  -get -y install docker compose
sudo usermod -aG docker $USER
```
The go programming language is installed and path variable is updated.
```markdown
wget -c https://dl.google.com/go/go1.12.17.linux-amd64.tar.gz -O - | sudo tar -xzf
export GOPATH=$HOME/go
```
Node.js version 8.9 to be installed as recommended. 

```markdown
curl -sL https://deb.nodesource.com/setup_8.9 -o nodesource_setup.sh
```

If you are using older version of linux such as 16.04, then install python 2.7.

```markdown
sudo apt-get install python
sudo bash nodesource_setup.sh
sudo apt install nodejs
```
Check the versions of the prerequests.
```markdown
docker -v
docker-compose -v
go version
node -v
npm -v
```
Finall step is downloading the Hyperledger Fabric 1.4 and samples.

```

## Prototype Architecture, starting traceapi and tracegui
The traceapi is a node.js application. Ideally every organization runs a copy of their api. The blockchain api uses wallet and blockchain network configuration to access the blockchain. In the current configuration organizational wallet is included in the api. The tracegui is a vuetify application and calls the api functions.

1. Run the blockchain network and.
2. Run the api server.
3. Run the client application.


For running the blockchain network the first-network example is used as a baseline. The  contract is updated with standardparts(SPgolang.go). Download the fabric samples. Update the contract file in the contract directory. Then update the installation script to run the file.

```markdown
npm install
npm start
```

First the API files are copied to your machine. In the server directory first the npm is intalled and server is run. 

```markdown
npm install
npm start
```

The client gui is also coped to folder in the aerver machine. The configuration of the api should be present in the client gui. The client web applicaiton is built and started. 

```markdown
npm install
nnpm run serve
```


```markdown

```
Finally check the application from the you browser. The initial three parts that ecist in the initial contract can be seen/

## The Scenario

The scenario is run on a presinstalled tracegui, traceapp and blockchain[itopp.nl/ORGID](itopp.nl/ORG1). See external access for calling api from python by connecting server [partsledger.tk/transactionname](partsledger.tk/queryAllTRU).


### Organizations

The network conssists of a manufacturer, third party logistics companies(3PL), distributer and maintanence&repair(M&R) organization. 

Manufacturer: Manufacturer is an OEM that produces parts for the market. When the parts are produced, the GTIN is recorded that includes the manufacturer ID.

Distributor: Distributor gets parts from the market, mostly manufacutrers, and sells them to the other parties.

3PL: 3PLs also buys and sells the parts. Additionally they can perform maintenance work on the parts and install them.

MRO: MRO organizations installs parts on the aerospace systems.

As new organizations are added thay are included in the blockchain and assigned a unique ORGID. Organizations have certificates.

For the tutorial example, we work on a network with six organizations.

### Traceable Resource Unit (TRU)

Each traceable part grouping is called a Traceable Resource Unit(TRU) and identifiable by a unique id(TRUID) assigned in the blockchain. The summary of the data tables and relations can be explained as follows:

-Each TRU is unique and corresponds to physical batch. TRU information can be aupdated by the owner organization.
-The history of changes of TRU information is stored in the TRACE entries. The organizations can only update the TRACE information for the TRU they own.
-When TRU is shipped, the change of ownership is allowed. The new owner can get the ownership. The old TRACE is copied to new owner. 

The TRU and TRACE data tables is provided below.

```


### The User Interface 

Two main screens exist in the interface. One for listing the TRUs in the system and one for listing the TRACE of a particular TRU. The specific functions on each screen is listed below. 


![image](/assets/images/list.jpg)

By clicking trace one can enter the trace interface.

Create Part 

TRU can be produced by a manufacturer. After production it is registered to blockchain.  

![image](/assets/images/create.jpg)


Part creations is done through createTRU transaction. This is coupled to manufacturing and testing of the TRU. After manufacturer completes the manufacturing,  cre in the blockchain by submitting the transaction.

** Operations on Parts as Transactions **

*Internal Operations*

Internal operations are provided by the TRU owner organization.

![image](/assets/images/create.jpg)

A TRU can be created with the GTIN(producer-productnumber combination), quantitry, CoC and batchnumber combination.

![image](/assets/images/maintenance.jpg)

If TRU is maintained the appropriate CoC is appended with the maintenance CoC.

![image](/assets/images/update.jpg)

If TRU is used the quantity of TRU is updated.

![image](/assets/images/use.jpg)

If TRU is used the quantity of TRU is updated.

![image](/assets/images/split.jpg)

The TRU batch can be splitted as to provide different destinations for each batch. The quantity of the new batch is specified. 

*Boundary Operations*

Boundary operations are performed during the change of ownership of TRU. These are ship and changeownership operations. 

When a part is shipped, following operations are performed.

1. The buyer organization is selected and payment term is selected. This is done via ship transaction.

![image](/assets/images/ship.jpg)

2. After the ship transaction is completed, a QR code is generated for the buyer to scan. This links to the page displaying trace and link to ownership change transaction.

![image](/assets/images/QR.jpg)


3. The buyer scans the QR code. The trace is displayed and link to ownership change transaction.

![image](/assets/images/newownertrace.jpg)


4. The buyer confirms terms and ownership change. TRU is updated and a new set of trace entries are created for the buyer.

Dispute

Dispute transaction is used for dispute management.

### Use Case 1: Back-to-Birth Trace

You can see the trace of the TRU6 for the M&R organization. It includes every operation the part has gone through from naufacturing.



### Use Case 2: Dispute Resolution through Consistent/Trusted Common Trace

The trace data for TRU6 for M&R and the supplier is shown respectively. So the supplier trace is the same as the trace of M&R organization accept the latest operations. The supplier can see the exact problem as reported as dispute and take action. 



### Use Case 3: Access Controlled Trace Data

The trace data can be modified by the owner organization and not the others. Upon shipping, only getOWN transaction can be called first. After this trace data is owned and modified by the current owner only.


### Use Case 4: Payment Notice
